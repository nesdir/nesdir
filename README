##NES Directory

These files can be used to generate the NES Directory site.

Usage:
xsltproc [filename].xsl cartdb.xml

Alternatively, run the "generate.sh" shell script.

Future modifications should stick with the XSLT 1.0 specification.
This way, no heavy Java-based XSLT processors are imposed upon the user.
